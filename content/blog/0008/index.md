At age 7, my family got a new dog. My dad tried to teach me how the dog would be trained so that I could contribute to, or at least not detract from, the process. One thing I remember is how he taught the dog to stay off the couch. If we were around, we could tell the dog to stay off the couch. But when we were not, he put stools on the couch. I asked him:

  > *Dad, don't we need to teach the dog she's not supposed to be on the couch? If the stools just block her, will she understand?*		

  > *The goal is to keep her off the couch. If she can't go up, she won't go up. After a while the stools won't be needed.*

I found this to be at once surprising and obvious. On the one hand, it's not clear if we "teach" the dog anything. Yet the point is not whether she understandsâ€“we just want her not to go on the couch. 

It took me a long time to see how this applied to me. 

In an earlier post (which I wrote an hour ago) I described how difficult it was for me to come around to admitting and forgiving my own faults and mistakes. Before that, I believed I could completely free myself of the challenges I face when trying to reach my goals. I felt that my habits, my stressors, my distractions, and my personality could all be molded and that I was marching on a linear path to becoming a perfectly productive person. 

The underlying belief was that discipline was like some universally valuable muscle. The more I willed myself to do difficult things, the more easily I would be able to accomplish all things. Unfortunately, I've observed two things that invalidate that thinking:
- First, such discipline and motivation isn't perfectly transferrable between domains. Otherwise anyone who displayed great work ethic as an athlete would show the same ethic as a student, as a romantic partner, as a member of their household, etc.
- Second, there's no finish line where things get easy. If you stop maintaining a habit, you'll just revert back to your old self. 

While it hurts to give up on that belief, doing so has allowed me to resort to much more practical ways of managing myself. Because I am less inclined to see the struggle as an end in itself, I elect to make things easier for myself when possible, without shame or concern for why I feel the need to do so. 

For example, I've often had troubles waking up in the morning. I've tried waking up at different times, sleeping for different times, using a different alarm, and various other things. These things have had various effects on when I awake or how I feel in the first few hours of the day, but they've never changed the fact that it's a struggle for me to go from awake to being out of bed.

I wanted to be the type of person who gets up right away, and in 15 minutes is showered, clothed, and ready for the day. And I believed that if I could just force the habit, I'd become someone who naturally behaves that way. 

I don't see it that way anymore. I don't see it as a lack of discipline that it's difficult for me, it's just the way things have always been. I do believe I could get in the habit of getting up faster, but my perspective has changed in how I am inclined to approach this. 

A younger me would have summoned up the Nike slogan: *just do it*. Let pride and desire be the only tools, and prove to myself I can will such things into being.

But now I ask, *what is the goal?* Do I need to transform my personality such that I  eagerly spring out of bed like clockwork? Or do I just need to get out of bed?

 Today, I see the goal for what it is, which is not some masochistic demonstration of will-power, but to get up. It doesn't pain me to admit that getting up is a struggle for me, and I have no insecurities about my capacity for discipline. So I turn to a simpler solution: just move my phone away from the bed. 

It turns out, if I have to get out of bed to turn off an alarm anyway, then I am already up. It's not pleasant, but it pretty much leaves me no choice. At that point, I'm standing and it's a hell of a lot easier to get a move on.

To be clear: I *do* believe in the power of forming a habit. I believe the power of habit can overcome natural tendencies. I just don't see any reason to make it harder to get there than it has to be.

The same applies to plenty of cases. If you're frustrated that you can't seem to stop yourself eating more potato chips than you should, you can think: *How will I ever achieve my goals if I can't put the bag down after one serving? How shameful is that?* Ideally, you'd be able to enjoy it in moderation, and you might think that if you force the issue then some day you won't be someone who struggles internally not to go back for more. 

Or you could stop buying chips. Go grocery shopping when you're not hungry, and make the decision just once. Then they won't be in your home that week. Instead of putting yourself to the test of resisting readily-available temptation, just avoid it. 

If you have the self-respect and confidence to be okay with the challenges you face, then why wouldn't you make things a bit easier on yourself? It's starts with admitting your flaws, and leads to more progress over time.
