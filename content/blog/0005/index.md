I find myself somewhat disillusioned with the wisdom I hear around how founders start companies. I'm not expecting to find a playbook, but I do feel some frustration with paths being laid out in direct contradiction to each other. Some questions I think about are:

- Who should start a company?
- When should one start a company?
- How do you start a company?
- How do you get a good idea?
- How much does the idea matter?
- Who should you team up with?

In one corner of my mind I have a somewhat traditional story: a founder starts a company in an area she knows well and solves a problem she's had or seen firsthand. Her focus is on building a product which produces value for the intended customer.

On the other hand, I have a contrary picture: a founder starts a company as a college student, and the initial idea has little to do with the ultimate success which comes several pivots later. Success is attributed to the grit of the founding team.

Is there a common ground here? The second one seems Silicon Valley-centric to me, although I think I've heard all kinds of answers to these questions from all kinds of people. The second story can be particularly discouraging because it evokes the image of a *wunderkind*, and you feel like you've either missed your window or that you simply weren't born with the traits you'd need to start a company. In this way, the stories that glorify founders–which should be inspirational–might actually serve to dissuade people from pursuing their own venture by implying that the glorified figure is who you have to be to succed.

In a way, however, realizing these contradictions brings me optimism. Hearing advice describing a very particular path makes it easy to see where you don't fit the mold; hearing wildly different stories attributing their sucess to directly conflicting aspects makes it possible that you don't have to fit any mold. I guess my concerns about mixed messages might be met with the aphorism that "every startup is a unique story". 

But still, some of us are looking for actionable insights.

With that said, the answers to these questions are non-exhaustive; the same people who have conflicting takes can agree on other answers. So here are some un-original thoughts that might be generally agreed upon:

- A company founder should be someone who is excited for the company and the process of building it.
- You should start a company by finding a need or opportunity you think you can address.
- You can get ideas by starting with identifying problems and shortcomings.
