At age 7, my family got a new dog. My dad tried to teach me how the dog would be trained so that I could contribute to, or at least not detract from, the process. One thing I remember is how he taught the dog to stay off the couch. If we were around, we could tell the dog to stay off the couch. But when we were not, he put stools on the couch. I asked him:

  > *Dad, don't we need to teach the dog she's not supposed to be on the couch? If the stools just block her, will she understand?*		

  > *The goal is to keep her off the couch. If she can't go up, she won't go up. Then after a while the stools aren't needed.*

I found this to be at once surprising and obvious. On the one hand, it's not clear if we "teach" the dog anything. Yet the point is not whether she understandsâ€“we just want her not to go on the couch. 

It took me a long time to see how this applied to me. 

I've always been in constant little battles with myself. The regular candidates are eating healthier, starting work earlier, doing chores more consistently, procrastinating less, and waking up at a certain time. Some times, especially in high school, I would embark on extreme solutions to the problem. For a while, I started every assignment within 6 hours of getting it.  I woke up at 4:30am. I went a year in college without eating any foods with added sugars (which is more inconvenient than you'd expect).

There was an underlying belief that I could mold my own mind to withstand distractions and unhelpful urges, and That if I reached a certain level, these things would no longer present any struggle to keep up. I thought I could reach some sort of soldier-like consistency which I could then apply to anything, at any time, for the rest of my life. 

Unfortunately it doesn't work that way. There are not permanent ways to change your own desires or tendencies. If you eat too much sugar, stopping eating it for a year will cause you to eat less sugar for a year. But as far as "rewiring" yourself? I think maybe a month or two after stopping my strict diet I felt about the same desire as I did before (although my tastes did move toward subtler sweets like dark chocolate).

Ultimately, I was making excuses for my own flaws. I tried to see them as temporary speedbumps, and I had a super-heroic image of who I wanted to be once I was over those bumps.

College forced me to accept some of my flaws. I found that my workload and commitments were too much for me after my procrastination and poor study habits, and I was not meeting my goals.

Most importantly, no series of excuses could be strewn together to change the story. No amount of all-nighters could catch me up, so I could not just say I achieved the same result in a different way. More difficult to accept was this: even if I hadn't procrastinated, there were students I'd met who would still have done better than me. And beyond that: I'd met people who were better than me at all subjects. Like everyone, I was not as special as I wanted to believe. 

The bright side of this embarassingly delayed learning experience was to take a healthier approach to managing myself. First, I could admit mistakes and forgive myself for them. 

It's hard to explain to people who haven't been there, but often times the students staying up all night at the end of a semester were there as a form of subconcious self-punishment. We didn't see ourselves as bad students, but great students damaged by the monkeys on their backs. By attempting to make up for lost time with late-stage heroics, we sought to chastise ourselves into better behavior in the next semester and to convince ourselves that we were still exceptional performers even if our actions didn't reflect it.

It turns out, the negative emotion that we build up by procrastinating and being too afraid to acknowledge it only leads to more procrastination[^1].
