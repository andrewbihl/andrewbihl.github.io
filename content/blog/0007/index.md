I've always been in constant little battles with myself. The regular candidates are eating healthier, starting work earlier, doing chores more consistently, procrastinating less, and waking up at a certain time. Some times, especially in high school, I would embark on extreme solutions to the problem. For a while, I started every assignment within 6 hours of getting it.  I woke up at 4:30am. I went a year in college without eating any foods with added sugars (which is more inconvenient than you'd expect).

There was an underlying belief that I could mold my own mind to withstand distractions and unhelpful urges, and that if I reached a certain level, these things would no longer present any struggle. I thought I could reach some sort of soldier-like consistency which I could then apply to anything, at any time, for the rest of my life. 

Unfortunately it doesn't work that way. There are not permanent ways to change your own desires or tendencies. If you eat too much sugar, stopping eating it for a year will cause you to eat less sugar for a year. But as far as "rewiring" yourself? I think maybe a month or two after stopping my strict diet I felt about the same desire as I did before (although my tastes did move toward subtler sweets like dark chocolate).

Ultimately, I was making excuses for my own flaws. I tried to see them as temporary speedbumps, and I had a super-human image of who I wanted to be once I was over those bumps.

My university experience forced me to accept some of my flaws. For the first time, my workload and commitments were too much for me to compensate my procrastination and poor study habits. The debt I'd build up over the course of a semester could simply not be made up with extra work later on, and I was not meeting my goals.

Most importantly, no series of excuses could be strewn together to change the story. No amount of all-nighters could catch me up, so I could not just say I achieved the same result in a different way. More difficult to accept was this: even if I hadn't procrastinated, there were students I'd met who would still have done better than me. And beyond that, I'd met people who were better than me in every subject. Like most of us, I am less special than I wanted to believe. 

The bright side of this embarassingly delayed learning experience was to take a healthier approach to managing myself. First, I began to admit my mistakes and forgive myself for them. 

It's hard to explain to people who haven't been there, but often times the students staying up all night at the end of a semester were there as a form of subconcious self-punishment. We didn't see ourselves as bad students, but great students hindered by the monkeys on our backs. By attempting to make up for lost time with late-stage heroics, we sought to chastise ourselves into better behavior in the next semester and to convince ourselves that we were still exceptional performers, even when our actions didn't reflect it.

It turns out, the negative emotion that we build up by procrastinating and being too afraid to acknowledge it only leads to more procrastination[^1].

Furthermore, the experience of pulling off these heroics overshadows the memory of the mundane process to get there. Running a marathon is a much more visceral, memorable thing than over-eating at a meal. In fact, it's more memorable than over eating at hundreds of meals. And when you think, "am I taking care of my health" it's hard not to first think of the marathon you powered through.

Again, it's just perverse self-preservation of the ego. And while it may have worked for a while to maintain a proud self-image, it's an image built on underlying shame and frustration. And ultimately, it doesn't get you where you want to go.
